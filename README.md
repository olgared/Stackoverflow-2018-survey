# Stack Overflow 2018 Annual Developer Survey

About a year ago I decided to change from being stay at home mom of three and working part-time for our family business. I became a student again, after graduating from University twenty something years ago.

In this project my goal is to take a closer look at Stack Overflow 2018 Annual Developer Survey to explore possibilities of changing my career at age 46. The data was downloaded from [Stack Overflow site](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

I used Descriptive statistics to find answers to following questions:

1. How many people come to the field being 45 and older?
2. What is the most popular job titles within newcomers?
3. Who has bigger starting salary newcomers under 25 or over 45?

**The following libraries have been used:**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib 

### Files:
- stackoverflow_survey.ipynb - a Jupyter Notebook with the code for this project

### Conclusion:

Only 48 individuals of my age with experience in coding less than 2 years are decided to participate in this survey. I compared two age groups of newcomers to the industry(18-24y.o. and 45-54y.o.) The most popular jobs for both groups are Backend-Developer and Frontend-Developer. Mean Salary for those groupsis higher for 45-54 years old. 
With all the knowledge that I have gained from this research, I can confidently say that although it may seem daunting to enter a new industry at 46 years old, it definitely isnâ€™t impossible.
