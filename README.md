# Stack Overflow 2018 Annual Developer Survey

In this project my goal is to take a closer look at Stack Overflow 2018 Annual Developer Survey to explore possibilities of changing my career at age 46. The data was downloaded from [Stack Overflow site](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

The following libraries have been used:
**numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn** 

I used Descriptive statistics to find answers to following questions:

1. How many people come to the field being 45 and older?
2. What is the most popular job titles within newcomers?
3. Who has bigger starting salary newcomers under 25 or over 45?
